    <p>Noodles are a type of food made from unleavened dough which is rolled flat
         and cut, stretched or extruded, into long strips or strings. Noodles are a 
         staple food in many cultures.<br> While long, thin strips may be the most common,
          many varieties of noodles are cut into waves, helices, tubes, strings, 
          or shells, or folded over, or cut into other shapes. 
          Noodles are usually cooked in boiling water, sometimes with cooking oil 
          or salt added. They are often pan-fried or deep-fried. Noodles are often 
          served with an accompanying sauce or in a soup.</p>
